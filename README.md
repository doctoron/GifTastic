HW Assignment using the Giphy API to populate images on a page.
My plan:
Use  the following code  to create this app:
The default page will use a Jamaican reggae legend. 
Bob Marley will appear in numerous giphy images around the frame
with a display of the current weather in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
file:///Users/ranton/bootcamp/06-ajax/Activities/05-Bujumbura/05S-MoBay/moBay-weather.html

A call to the weather will appear in the center(ish) of the page.

A input field will allow the user to add their own area(s) of interest, all of which will be
appended to the array, with a button created for each topic.  **
**Ten images will be returned for each topic with the rating of the image displayed.

Hopefully this will be deployed very soon!
