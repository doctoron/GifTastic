HW Assignment using the Giphy API to populate images on a page.
My plan:
Use  the following code  to create this app:
The default page will use a Jamaican reggae legend. 
Bob Marley will appear in numerous giphy images around the frame
with a display of the current weather in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
file:///Users/ranton/bootcamp/06-ajax/Activities/05-Bujumbura/05S-MoBay/moBay-weather.html

A call to the weather will appear in the center(ish) of the page.

A input field will allow the user to add their own area(s) of interest, all of which will be
appended to the array, with a button created for each topic.  **
**Ten images will be returned for each topic with the rating of the image displayed.

** Discovery that Open Weather API documentation provided conversion of Cº to Fº (imperial units)!
READ API DOCUMENTATION!

** Eurika!  We have a working draft to push before deadline.  **

** Now to create the input fields to grab user search interest. 

** Need to find a really nice font set for the weather data.

** Ideas for future version might add:
## A search for weather in other cities 
Need more time to dig deeper into the https://apilist.fun/i/geonames-api API 

## Listing of namedays for country (trivia) 
https://apilist.fun/i/namedays-calendar

## Currency conversion:
